# DataBear-DataVisualizationMadeEasy
Say hello to Data Bear(DB),  an open source, data-visualization bot! 

 This bot was made to run on Python 3.12.8
 Data Bear(DB) is an innovative open source bot designed around solving the issues around data visualization. Sending CSV files to friends/coworkers is incredibly unintuitive. If you want a quick summary/graph of the data while sending DB is for you!

 Send any CSV file in any channel and DB will respond with graphs of that data. This saves you the hassle of opening the CSV on your own, and using graphing software to copy the image and bring it back to Discord. Instead this 4 step process becomes  integrated seamlessly with your routine.

 Further, DB is completely open-source!

 Feel free to contribute to this project! There will be mnay and frequent updates to this project!
