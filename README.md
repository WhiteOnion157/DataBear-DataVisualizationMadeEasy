# DataBear-DataVisualizationMadeEasy
Say hello to Data Bear(DB), an open source, data-visualization bot! 

This bot was made to run on Python 3.12.8
Data Bear(DB) is an open source bot designed around solving issues around data visualization. Sending CSV files to friends/coworkers can be incredibly unintuitive. If you want a quick summary/graph of the data while sending, then DB is for you! You can send any CSV file in any channel and DB will respond with summary/graph of that data using graphing software to copy the image and bring it back to Discord. 

 Feel free to contribute to this project! There will be more updates to this project!
